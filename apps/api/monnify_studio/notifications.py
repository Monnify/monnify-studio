"""Real notifications for generated products (#99).

The seller's product actually reaches people: when a buyer gets an invoice, and
again when Monnify confirms their payment, we message them (WhatsApp and/or
email, whichever contact they left) and record it so it also shows up in the
dashboard's Notifications feed.

Sends are best-effort: if a channel is not configured or a send fails, the
product still works, the failure is logged, and the record notes it. A
notification is never in the money-decision path.
